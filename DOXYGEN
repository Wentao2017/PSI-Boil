I have to decide how to insert doxygen documentation.

Generally, I think the following order could be adopted:

1 - brief description,
2 - parameters,
3 - detailed description.

It remains to be decided where to place all of these, into
header files, or in the source files.

I might try to follow these guidelines:

1 - if function is defined in header, then there is no
    doubt, everything has to be defined in the header.

2 - if function is defined in the source, I might do the
   
2.1. public functions:

     - brief description in the header

     - parameters in header for construtord,
       preferably in the header for other functions

     - detailed descriptions in the source

2.2. private/protected: everything in the source. 

3 - for functions in children, descriptions can be done in
    parent ... hmm ... not sure yet.

These rules can not be followed strictly. For some instances
header files might become to large and clumsy.
